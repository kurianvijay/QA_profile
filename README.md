I am a dynamic and ambitious Full Stack Junior Developer, keen to enter the world of tech in a role where I can consolidate and extend my programming knowledge, while also gaining exposure to product management and business strategy.

Throughout my experience at Makers Academy, I have understood the importance of best coding practices and this is my biggest priority in looking for my next role. I would love to work in a committed and supportive team, where these practices are adhered to.

In the last 10 years I've had 2 jobs and I started the second job midway through my first job. To clarify I co-founded Edge360(www.edge360.co.uk), a digital mobile ad-serving company, in 2015 along with 2 of my friends. I did this while working full time at the Heathrow airport T5 training department where we, a 17 strong team, were in charge of training just over 1500 members of staff.

Edge360 branched out into app development about 18 months after we started as we wanted to establish a  dedicated pipeline for some of the ad campaigns we managed. All 3 of us started  as part time employees and in 2016 one of the co-founders went into it full time and I took the leap in March 2017. In April 2018 our turnover crossed GBP 3 million and we had expanded our team to 13 people however I felt that we as a company were too focused on new business generation at the cost customer retention and sustainability. In Janusry 2019, after having discussed it with my partners and my wife, I decided to sell most of the shares I had in the company and step back from an operational role at Edge360.

#### Why I want to be a developer?

One of my main areas of responsibility at Edge360 was product management and monetisation which meant most of my time was spent with the development team. My job was to clarify the requirements of the business around various functionalities that the team was being asked to implement for the apps i.e clarifying user stories.
A lot of times I found myself more drawn to the code and how it was working and I sent quite a few questions on the code itself, at times perhaps unnecessarily, to my developers. I loved the problem solving aspect of coding and how one problem could have multiple solutions. I started to attempt coding challenges on code-wars and courses on thefreecodecamp.com in my already limited free time and found that I enjoyed them immensely. With support from my wife, a developer herself, I decided to take the plunge in early 2019 and haven't looked back since.

I have always enjoyed building products that add value to a business or customer experience and now I believe I have a chance to  be involved in this again from a different perspective, that of the developer, and I am immensely looking forward to that.

## Skills

#### Strategic planning

Having worked on a variety of projects at Makers Academy, setting objectives and focusing on code architecture and design, enabled me to work towards achieving projects' goals in the most efficient and effective way. Proof are the team projects built, such as Acebook.

Being introduced to project management in the last 4 years, I really enjoyed bringing projects to a successful end with maximum efficiency. I enjoyed leading and developing small teams as well as solving complex and strategic problems. By managing a team of 6 people in my first role as a project manager, I achieved maximum performance and finished the project 4% under the expenditure budget, by making the best use of time and resources.

#### Communication

Both at Makers Academy and in my previous career I developed strong communication and stakeholder management skills. While at Makers Academy I worked collaboratively with my colleagues on multiple group projects in an agile environment and under tight deadlines. My ability to communicate the problems I face when coding, as well as explaining what I intend to do in a simple, yet understandable manner, is what helped me succeed in my pairing sessions and group projects at Makers. Good communication and feedback in pairing sessions was great for actively learning and have better productivity and code quality. I also coached one student from the junior cohort, helping them navigate through Makers' challenges.

In one of the key projects at Makers (Acebook), I took the lead in upskilling the team in Ruby on Rails, mobbing the first feature - the sign-up process. This way all members of the team got introduced to Ruby on Rails and Active Record, thus making the pairing process in the following days more effective, as everyone got to understand how Rails works.

At Edge360, in order to manage my team effectively and increase productivity, I established a daily process consisting of morning standups, prioritisation of workload and status reports with the team. Over the course of the first quarter after these changes were implemented, every member of my team exceeded their sales targets.

#### Self motivation
Working in a fast-paced environment made me understand the value of self-progression. I have always thrived to improve my existing skills by learning and developing myself. I started learning how to code while working full time in a job that constantly required my focus and attention. Before Makers I could create the simplest of web pages. Today I can create full stack applications using technologies such as Ruby on Rails (see my contribution to Acebook) and Javascript(see Thermostat).

#### Adaptability
During the Makers Academy course, I have proactively sought out new challenges, as I believe this is the best way to cultivate a growth mindset. I am capable of taking on new technologies and learn new practices rapidly and efficiently; also able to deal with sudden or frequent changes on coding projects, by continuing to work and understand what is required to be changed in the code; proof are the projects I have completed while at Makers. For the final project our team choose to work with 2 completely new technologies, Python and React, we managed to complete it on time and one of our key features which was to embed a Google location API for users was driven and implemented with me taking the lead.
